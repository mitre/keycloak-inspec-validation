## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results.

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall)__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
